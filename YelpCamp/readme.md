## ‚öñÔ∏è Methodology

- Used a [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html#ModelViewController) [Monolithic Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYhRvH9tJKw) since it's the most simple architecture to gain an introduction to full-stack web development. Building a MVC Monolith allows one to gain a perspective on the range of achitectures, particularly the lower-end of the range. The Monolith Architecture falls short in scalability and separation of front-end and back-end. The MVC Architecture falls short when the application begins to grow in complexity with the addition of services that could stand on thier own. The MVC Architecture is [perhaps best used for simple proof-of-concept projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rckfN7xFig0), like this one.
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) as the CSS framework to keep the UI simple and quick to build. Since the website takes a performance hit for loading Bootstrap, took full advantage of advanced Bootstrap features such as [custom validation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/validation) for all forms and [animated form input](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/floating-labels) for the login and register pages.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) as the Node.js application framework since it's a lightweight framework, which is ideal for gaining an understanding of how to build the backend from scratch. Compared to a framework like [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com) or even [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), Express.js doesn't have many features out of the box.
- [PassportJs](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) for the authentication and authorization.
- NoSQL database for the flexibility compared to a SQL database, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) in particular because of its prevalence in the industry.
- [Embedded Javascript Templates (EJS)](https://ejs.co) as the front-end templating language for more DRY code compared to plain HTML and for dynamic user-experiences. This is a simple templating language, similar to [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x) for Python. Both however fall short on front-end scalability, modularity, and performance compared to a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org). Working with simple templating languges helps to remind me the benefits of working with a framework like React.
- [Render](https://render.com) as the cloud hosting provider.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) to create SVG illustrations from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of SVG. I don't plan on creating SVG graphics from scratch often, but now that I know how to do it, I can easily edit existing SVGs. If I'm unable to find an open-source SVG, now I can always create one exactly as needed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### To run this project on your system:

Create an .env file and add values to the following variables:

```
GEOCODER_API_KEY=
API_KEY=
DATABASEURL=
PASSPORT_SECRET=
ADMIN_CODE=
```

Make sure you have [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation) installed on your system
In a terminal window, initialize a MongoDB Database

```
$ ./mongod
```

In a second terminal window, access the MongoDB Database with Mongoose

```
$ mongoose
```

In a third terminal window, install dependencies using npm:

```
$ npm install
```

And then run the application with

```
$ npm start
```

or for hot reloading (recommended)

```
$ nodemon app.js
```
